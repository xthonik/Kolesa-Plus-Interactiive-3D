## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 3d-plus
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project
To start the local development server, run:
```
npm run dev
```
Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) to view the application.

## Usage
- The `index.html` file serves as the entry point for the application.
- The `src/main.js` file initializes the Three.js scene and imports the `PlusScene` class for coin rotation logic.
- Modify the `src/PlusScene.js` file to change the rotation behavior or add new features.
